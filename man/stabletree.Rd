\title{Stability Assessment for Tree Learners}

\description{
  Stability assessment of variable and cutpoint selection in
  tree learners (i.e., recursive partitioning). By refitting
  trees to resampled versions of the learning data, the stability
  of the trees structure is assessed and can be summarized and
  visualized.
}

\usage{
  stabletree(x, data = NULL, sampler = subsampling, weights = NULL,
    applyfun = NULL, cores = NULL, savetrees = FALSE, \dots)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{fitted model object. Any tree-based model object that can be coerced
    by \code{\link{as.party}} can be used provided that suitable methods
    are provided.}
  \item{data}{an optional \code{data.frame}. By default the learning data from \code{x}
    is used (if this can be inferred from the \code{\link{getCall}} of \code{x}.}
  \item{sampler}{a resampling (generating) function. Either this should be a function
    of \code{n} that returns a matrix or a sampler generator like
    \code{\link{subsampling}}.}
  \item{weights}{an optional matrix of dimension n * B that can be used to 
    weight the observations from the original learning data when the trees 
    are refitted. If \code{weight = NULL}, the \code{sampler} will be used.}
  \item{applyfun}{a \code{\link{lapply}}-like function. The default is to use
    \code{\link{lapply}} unless \code{cores} is specified in which case
    \code{\link{mclapply}} is used (for multicore computations on platforms
    that support these).}
  \item{cores}{integer. The number of cores to use in multicore computations
    using \code{\link{mclapply}} (see above).}
  \item{savetrees}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, trees based on resampled data sets are returned.}
  \item{\dots}{further arguments passed to \code{sampler}.}
}

\details{
  The function \code{stabletree} assesses the stability of tree learners (i.e.,
  recursive partitioning methods) by refitting the tree to resampled versions
  of the learning data. By default, if \code{data = NULL}, the fitting call is
  extracted by \code{\link{getCall}} to infer the learning data.
  Subsequently, the \code{sampler} generates \code{B} resampled versions
  of the learning data, the tree is regrown with \code{\link{update}},
  and (if necessary) coerced by \code{\link{as.party}}. For each
  of the resampled trees it is queried and stored which variables are selected
  for splitting and what the selected cutpoints are.

  The resulting object of class \code{"stabletree"} comes with a set of 
  standard methods to generic functions including \code{print}, \code{summary}
  for numerical summaries and \code{plot}, \code{barplot}, and \code{image}
  for graphical representations. See \code{\link{plot.stabletree}} for more
  details. In most methods, the argument \code{original} can be set to
  \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}, turning highlighting of the original tree 
  information on and off.
}

\value{
  \code{stabletree} returns an object of class \code{"stabletree"} which is a list with
    the following components:
  \item{call}{the call from the model object \code{x},}
  \item{B}{the number of resampled datasets,}
  \item{sampler}{the \code{sampler} function,}
  \item{vs0}{numeric vector of the variable selections of the original tree,} 
  \item{br0}{list of the break points (list of \code{nodeids}, \code{levels}, and
    \code{breaks}) for each variable of the original tree,}
  \item{vs}{numeric matrix of the variable selections for each resampled dataset,}
  \item{br}{list of the break points (only the \code{breaks} for each variable over all
    resampled datasets,}
  \item{classes}{character vector indicating the classes of all partitioning variables,}
  \item{trees}{a list of tree objects of class \code{"party"}, or \code{NULL}.}
